## the cutom CSS I wrote

the only custom css I used was some little image adjustments for my header image

## the most challenging component was the toast

The toast notification was definitely the hardest. Unlike other Bootstrap components that just work with HTML, I had to write JavaScript to make it show up when you click the button. I had to look up how Bootstrap's JavaScript API works, which was new to me.

## easiest component was the dropdown in the nav

The dropdown menu in the navbar was super easy. I just had to add the right classes and  and it worked immediately.

## how bootstrap helped in my code

Bootstrap made everything way faster to build. Instead of writing a bunch of CSS for responsive design, I just used their grid system and utility classes. The components look pretty professional without me having to figure out all the styling details, and everything is pretty mobile friendly automatically.

## what I liked and did not

    What I liked:
- Most components work with just the htmkl with no JavaScript needed
- Utility classes are super convenient  
- The grid system makes responsive layouts easy, and is definetly faster for me when compared to flexbox

    What I did not like:
- Having to write JavaScript for tooltips and toasts feels inconsistent
- Some class names get really long
- I dont like the color limitation, I know I can add more colors with the latest version, but I would rather just use custom CSS to do any of it I actually think it's faster at least for me. I ended up just using the more basic colors for this site during the assignment because I did not want to do more if I'm being honest, I will be updating this project later with my own custom CSS.
